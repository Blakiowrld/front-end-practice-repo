      <p>
        My journey into web development began with one powerful language: <strong>HTML</strong>. At first, I thought building a website required some sort of magic. But I quickly realized HTML was more about structure and clarity than complexity. In this blog post, I want to walk you through what I've learned so far.
      </p>

      <p>
        HTML stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>. It's the backbone of every webpage on the internet. From paragraphs and images to videos and forms, HTML tells the browser what each part of the page is.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Semantic HTML Matters</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most important concepts I learned early on is the use of <strong>semantic HTML</strong>. Tags like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> help browsers and assistive technologies understand the content's purpose.
      </p>

      <pre><code>&lt;article&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;My First Post&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is my journey...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>
        Using semantic tags makes your website more accessible and improves SEO. It's also a cleaner way to organize your code.
      </p>

      <h2>Building My First Webpage</h2>
      <p>
        My first project was a simple portfolio site. I used HTML to create a homepage with my name, a brief bio, and a few links to other pages. Here's a snippet of the header I wrote:
      </p>

      <pre><code>&lt;header&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Judah&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="about.html"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>
        It was such a rewarding experience to see my page live in the browser. It might not have been fancy, but it was mine â€” and it worked!
      </p>

      <h2>What I Plan to Learn Next</h2>
      <p>
        After getting comfortable with HTML, my next step is to master CSS and then move into JavaScript. I want to make my sites more interactive and beautiful. Eventually, I hope to learn modern frameworks like React and tools like Git for version control.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're just starting out, I encourage you to experiment, make mistakes, and most importantly, have fun with it. HTML is just the beginning â€” the real magic happens when you keep going.
